* Programmes to elucidate Na+ diffusion coefficient from EIS data.

* [CurvedEIS](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/blob/main/Part%20II%20Code/EIS%20Analysis/CurvedEIS.ipynb) visualises the EIS curves on axes of real vs imaginary impedance.
* [EISAnglecalculator](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/blob/main/Part%20II%20Code/EIS%20Analysis/EISAnglecalculator.ipynb) identifies where the angle of the plot is 45&deg;: d(-Im(z))/d(Re(z)) = 1.
* [BestWarburg](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/blob/main/Part%20II%20Code/EIS%20Analysis/BestWarburg.ipynb) then plots this region on axes of Re(z) vs Ï‰^-1/2. The gradient of this linear plot is the Warburg coefficient.
* The Warburg coefficient, alongside various constants and C, the concentration of Na+ ions, permits elucidation of the Na+ diffusion coefficient, the trend for which is visualised in [Diffusioncoefficients](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/blob/main/Part%20II%20Code/EIS%20Analysis/Diffusioncoefficients.ipynb).
