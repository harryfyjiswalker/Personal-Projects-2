* Programmes to elucidate Na+ diffusion coefficient from EIS data.
* 

* Programmes for elucidating the Warburg coefficient from 
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy plots.(calculated as gradient 
of plot of real impedance against Ï‰^-1/2 for low-frequency region where 
d(-Zimaginary)/d(Zreal) = 1)
* This then allows elucidation of the Na+ diffusion coefficient, offering
insight into the physical properties responsible for variation in rate
performance
