This repository includes:
* Previous [programmes](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Part%20II%20Code) written during my Master's (2023-24) for electrochemical and structural analysis of Na-ion cathodes
* Documentation of subsequent work to improve grasp of ML theory & practice (DeepLearning.AI courses, Kaggle, Advent of Code etc.)
     - Current focus on improving skills in XGBoost and Named Entity Recognition for battery performance data extraction and analysis

For work on sodium-ion batteries, please see [Na_ion_independent_ research](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Na_ion_independent_research).
