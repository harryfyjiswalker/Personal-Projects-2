# Personal-Projects

This repository includes:
* Previous [programmes](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Part%20II%20Code) written during my Master's (2023-24) for electrochemical and structural analysis of Na-ion cathodes
* Practice of and notes on [key machine learning techniques](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Key%20ML%20Techniques%20-%20Notes%20and%20Practice), through:
   * Geron's "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow"
   * DeepLearningAI Labs
   * Kaggle Competitions
   * Current focus on developing grasp of [ensemble methods](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Key%20ML%20Techniques%20-%20Notes%20and%20Practice/Ensemble%20Methods)
* Notes on AI Theory from Andrew Ng & DeepLearning.AI's [Machine Learning, NLP, and Deep Learning Specialisations](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/DeepLearning.AI%20Course%20Notes%20and%20Labs/Machine%20Learning%20Specialisation%20Notes%20%26%20Code)
* Technical practice of fundamental Python skills through:
  * University of Helsinki's [Python Programming MOOC](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Python%20Practice/University%20of%20Helsinki%20Python%20Programming%20MOOC) (current progress: Part 3)
  * [Advent of Code](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Python%20Practice/Advent%20of%20Code%20Solutions)
  * [Exercism](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Python%20Practice/Exercism%20Exercises)
* Work on Na-ion batteries is documented in [Na_ion_independent_research](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Na_ion_independent_research). This includes pre-processing of existing databases (primarily Gou et al. (2024)'s recent [release](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03196-1)) and tentative attempts at building basic random forest models for predictive Na-ion modelling. However, I am for the next few weeks most focused on building a solid foundation in [decision tree and random forest systems](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Key%20ML%20Techniques%20-%20Notes%20and%20Practice/Ensemble%20Methods), before attempting any further application to the Na-ion context.
