# Personal-Projects

This repository includes:
* Previous [programmes](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Part%20II%20Code) written during my Master's (2023-24) for electrochemical and structural analysis of Na-ion cathodes
* Practice of [key machine learning techniques](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Key%20ML%20Techniques%20-%20Notes%20and%20Practice)), through Kaggle competitions and DeepLearningAI labs.
   - Current focus on improving skills in XGBoost and Named Entity Recognition for battery performance data extraction and analysis
* Documentation of progress through DeepLearning.AI's [Machine Learning Specialisation](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/DeepLearning.AI%20Course%20Notes%20and%20Labs/Machine%20Learning%20Specialisation%20Notes%20%26%20Code), [NLP Specialisation](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/DeepLearning.AI%20Course%20Notes%20and%20Labs/Machine%20Learning%20Specialisation%20Notes%20%26%20Code), and [Deep Learning Specialisation](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/DeepLearning.AI%20Course%20Notes%20and%20Labs/Machine%20Learning%20Specialisation%20Notes%20%26%20Code).
* Technical practice in Python through [Advent of Code](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Python%20Practice/Advent%20of%20Code%20Solutions) and [Exercism](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Personal-Projects-2/tree/main/Python%20Practice/Exercism%20Exercises).
    

For work on sodium-ion batteries, please see [Na_ion_independent_ research](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Na_ion_independent_research); repository documenting current research into ML applications to refugee support will be uploaded when more complete.
