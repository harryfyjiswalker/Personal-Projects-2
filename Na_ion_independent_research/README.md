Data mining: [Huang & Cole (2020)'s](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00602-2) database extractor does not extract current, which is needed for reliable comparison of discharge capacities. This is built on by [Guo et al. (2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11009284/), whose cathodedataextractor extracts capacity, current, and voltage limits from rate performance data, as well as cyclability data. 

Resulting questions I am investigating over coming months:
* Can we extend this to include phase composition to inform understanding of the relationship between structure and chemical properties, to build on Maughan et al. (2023)'s [progress](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-023-00337-8)?
* Can we then build predictive models for optimising battery composition based on these parameters for any layered-oxide structure type, building on Sekine et al. (2024)'s [success](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/ta/d4ta04809a) with the O3 structure?
