Diary of work:
* Multiple compatibility issues using [batterydataextractor repo](https://github.com/ShuHuang/batterydataextractor).
* Fixed issues regarding [nmslib installation on M1 Mac](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib/issues/464); successful installation of batterydataextractor.
* Training set [autogeneration](https://github.com/harryfyjiswalker/Na_ion_independent_research/blob/main/Data%20mining/Training%20Set%20Generation/090124%20Training%20Set.ipynb) for battery material name recognition. Struggling with accurate chemical composition recognition, returning to NLP course before reattempting. Also looking into prompt engineering using existing LLMs - may be more effective?
